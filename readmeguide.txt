If you are stuck as to what to include as answers, below is a guide to help create your README.md file:

Title:
Give a simple and easy-to-remember title for your project.

Description:
Provide a short description explaining the what, why and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project?
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Table of Contents:
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Installation:
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment up and running.

Usage:
How will users use this application?
For example: This application can allow users to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

License:
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.
A badge is usually included at the top after the title for professionalism.

Tests:
List any tests that have been performed.

Contributions:
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you used tutorials, include links to those here as well.

Questions:
Give contact details so users may contact you with any questions.


Copyright:
Sign off the README.md file with a company logo/copyright/signature.
