If you are stuck as to what to include as answers, below is a guide to help create your README.md file:

##Title
Give a simple and easy-to-remember title for your project.

ie. READ ME Generator

##Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project?
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

ie. A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

##Table of Contents
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

##Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment up and running.

ie. 
First, use git clone in the terminal to download the project
Then open the project in VS Code and in the package.json folder enter the terminal
Within the terminal, use npm install inquirer to install the inquirer package
The command-line application should work when node index.js is entered in the terminal

##Usage
How will user's use this application?
ie. This application can allow users to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

##Screenshot
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
OR 
Go into your Github once the screenshot has been committed to the repository, open the screenshot link, copy and paste the link from the browser into VS Code, adding ?raw=true to the end of the link. Add it to your README using the following syntax:

ie. ![alt text](https://github.com/hergemony/readmegenerator/blob/main/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-04-19%20at%2011.05.44%20am.png?raw=true)

##Video
Include a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality ie.using Screencastify or OBS video uploaded to Youtube.
Provide a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
ie. Template:
[![Alt text for your video](assets/images/Youtubescreenshotreadmegenerator.png)](https://youtu.be/xxGy6bumx08 "Put hover text here!")

https://youtu.be/xxGy6bumx08

##License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.
NB. A badge is usually included at the top after the title for professionalism. Use the following syntax:
ie. ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

##Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

##Tests
List any tests that have been performed. You may want to go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

##Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you used tutorials, include links to those here as well.

##Questions
Give contact details so users may contact you with any questions.

##Copyright
Sign off the README.md file with a company name/copyright/signature.

ie. ❤ Hergemony™ Digital Services 2022 ❤
