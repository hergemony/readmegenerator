If you are stuck as to what to include as answers, below is a guide to help create your README.md file:

##Title
Give a simple and easy-to-remember title for your project.

##Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project?
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

##Table of Contents
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

##Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment up and running.

##Usage
How will users use this application?
For example: This application can allow users to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

##Screenshot
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

##Video
Include a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality ie.using Screencastify or OBS.
Provide a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

##License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.
NB. A badge is usually included at the top after the title for professionalism.
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

##Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

##Tests
List any tests that have been performed. You may want to go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

##Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you used tutorials, include links to those here as well.

##Questions
Give contact details so users may contact you with any questions.

##Copyright
Sign off the README.md file with a company logo/copyright/signature.
